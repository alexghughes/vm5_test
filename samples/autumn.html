               <p>Diplomatic editions of MacGreevy's poetry were created from Collected Poems of Thomas MacGreevy: An Annotated Edition, edited by Susan Schreibman  (Anna Livia Press and The Catholic University of America Press, 1991). Images of MacGreevy's
                  published poems were taken from MacGreevy's own copy of Poems (Heinemann, 1934). Manuscript copies are from MacGreevy's papers at Trinity College, Dublin (individual manuscript numbers
                  appear in the witness list below).

                           <p>The alternative titles MacGreevy experimented with  provide the
                              			 key to this very short poem. By the autumn of 1922 over six years had passed
                              			 since Patrick Pearse had proclaimed the Irish Republic in Dublin's General Post
                              			 Office. The country had seen the heart of its capital destroyed by the fires of
                              			 Easter 1916, and this was followed after the Seinn Fein victory in the 1918
                              			 election by an extended campaign of guerilla warfare against the British with
                              			 its reprisals and counter-reprisals.
                           </p>
                                             
                           <p>In the end, nationalist Ireland was
                              			 divided into bitterly opposing camps, and engaged in civil war over the terms
                              			 of the agreement reached in London in December 1921. The new national
                              			 institutions that emerged did so more through the passage of time than as the
                              			 expression of any national ideal or vision. MacGreevy's poem captures the
                              			 despair and weariness of a nation torn apart by war and bitter political
                              			 divisions.
                           </p>

                           <p>The alternative titles MacGreevy experimented with  provide the
                              			 key to this very short poem. By the autumn of 1922 over six years had passed
                              			 since Patrick Pearse had proclaimed the Irish Republic in Dublin's General Post
                              			 Office. The country had seen the heart of its capital destroyed by the fires of
                              			 Easter 1916, and this was followed after the Seinn Fein victory in the 1918
                              			 election by an extended campaign of guerilla warfare against the British with
                              			 its reprisals and counter-reprisals.
                           </p>
                                             
                           <p>In the end, nationalist Ireland was
                              			 divided into bitterly opposing camps, and engaged in civil war over the terms
                              			 of the agreement reached in London in December 1921. The new national
                              			 institutions that emerged did so more through the passage of time than as the
                              			 expression of any national ideal or vision. MacGreevy's poem captures the
                              			 despair and weariness of a nation torn apart by war and bitter political
                              			 divisions.

               <p>The alternative titles MacGreevy experimented with  provide the
                  			 key to this very short poem. By the autumn of 1922 over six years had passed
                  			 since Patrick Pearse had proclaimed the Irish Republic in Dublin's General Post
                  			 Office. The country had seen the heart of its capital destroyed by the fires of
                  			 Easter 1916, and this was followed after the Seinn Fein victory in the 1918
                  			 election by an extended campaign of guerilla warfare against the British with
                  			 its reprisals and counter-reprisals.
               </p>
                                 
               <p>In the end, nationalist Ireland was
                  			 divided into bitterly opposing camps, and engaged in civil war over the terms
                  			 of the agreement reached in London in December 1921. The new national
                  			 institutions that emerged did so more through the passage of time than as the
                  			 expression of any national ideal or vision. MacGreevy's poem captures the
                  			 despair and weariness of a nation torn apart by war and bitter political
                  			 divisions.

                  				  Brueghel the Elder's The Triumph of Death, which depicts a whole society

               <div class="witnesses">t7989-1-9</div><strong>Biographical note: </strong>    MacGreevy published several poems and reviews under the pseudonym L. St. Senan in the early-mid 1920s. 
               Saint Senan (d.560) founded several monasteries in MacGreevy's  native Ireland. Senan's last settlement was on Scattery Island
               in the estuary of the Shannon, near MacGreevy's birthplace.
